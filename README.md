## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Minecraft worlds are stored locally on your computer. If your hard drive fails, the world file gets corrupted, or a creeper ruins your masterpiece during LAN play, all your hard work can be lost forever.

**MineSave** solves this problem by creating a timestamped `.zip` backup of your Minecraft world and securely uploading it to your personal **Google Drive**. You can restore any backup with a simple command, ensuring your creations are always safe.
